2. country_data.csv, which provides country-specific data.

Key aspects of the analysis include restaurant locations, cuisines, pricing, and customer reviews. The project will explore:

1. Factors that influence restaurant popularity.
2. The relationship between pricing and customer ratings.
3. The prevalence and impact of services such as online delivery and table booking.
