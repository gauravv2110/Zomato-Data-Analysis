# Zomato-Data-Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing two datasets:

rest_data.csv, which contains detailed information about restaurants, and
country_data.csv, which provides country-specific data.
Key aspects of the analysis include restaurant locations, cuisines, pricing, and customer reviews. The project will explore:

Factors that influence restaurant popularity.
The relationship between pricing and customer ratings.
The prevalence and impact of services such as online delivery and table booking.
By uncovering valuable insights, this project aims to support more informed decision-making for both customers and restaurateurs, contributing to a better understanding of the restaurant industry.
